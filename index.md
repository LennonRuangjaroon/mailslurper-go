### What Is MailSlurper?
MailSlurper is a simple SMTP server that slurps mail into oblivion! Having MailSlurper installed on your local
or shared development environment allows you to test sending email without having to go through the trouble
of configuring a real mail server. You also don't have to worry about emails actually going out to unintended
recipients.

Simply configure your application and/or application server stack to the host and port you are running
MailSlurper on and it will capture emails you send out into a database for later viewing. Then open
up your favorite web browser to http://localhost:8080 and you can view captured emails and their attachments!
